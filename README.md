**These code samples - some being personal projects and most being school projects/assignments - are NOT intended to represent my 'best' work or cleanest code as many of the assignments were rushed to meet hard, often weekly, deadlines.**
**These are just a handful of many more projects, more examples will continue to be committed to this repo** 

"QLearning" = Traditional reinforcement/self-learning implementation
"GAN" = Generative and Adversarial networks. Aka deep learning and image generation using Tensorflow + Python. See GIF file in folder.
